In design studies, design computing is the practice of design activities through the application and development of novel concepts and techniques in computing.

In recent years a number of research and education areas have been grouped under the umbrella term "Design Computing", namely:

Artificial Intelligence in Design
Artificial Architecture
Expert and Knowledge-based Systems
Computational creativity
Computer-Aided Design
Digital morphogenesis
Visual and Spatial Modelling
Computational Analogy
Automated Design Systems
Design Support Systems
Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)
Building Information Modeling (BIM)
